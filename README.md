## ‚ú® Motivation & Problem Statement

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have revolutionized machine learning due to their predictive power, but they are notorious black boxes‚Äîmaking it hard (or impossible) to understand *why* they make certain predictions. This lack of transparency is a serious limitation in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy, where interpretability is as crucial as accuracy.

Classical approaches like Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) offer full transparency: they let you visualize and trust every feature‚Äôs contribution, but often struggle to match the accuracy of neural networks when relationships are highly nonlinear or data is complex.

**Goal:** Combine the *interpretability* of GAMs with the *power and flexibility* of neural networks.

## üîé NAMs vs. GAMs: The Best of Both Worlds

**Generalized Additive Models (GAMs):**
- Predict the outcome as a sum of independent feature effects:
  \[
  g(E[y]) = \beta + f_1(x_1) + f_2(x_2) + \ldots + f_K(x_K)
  \]
- Each \( f_i(x_i) \) is a simple function (like a spline or low-degree polynomial).
- **Pros:** Easy to interpret‚Äîone can plot and analyze each feature‚Äôs effect.
- **Cons:** Limited to simple relationships; can‚Äôt model intricate, high-dimensional patterns.

**Neural Additive Models (NAMs):**
- Same additive structure as GAMs, but **each \( f_i(x_i) \) is parameterized as a neural network**, allowing much greater complexity:
  \[
  y = \beta + f_1^{NN}(x_1) + f_2^{NN}(x_2) + \ldots + f_n^{NN}(x_n)
  \]
- **Every feature has its own neural sub-network** (often a multilayer perceptron).
- **Each sub-network can learn flexible, nonlinear mappings** from feature input to effects.
- Retains all the interpretability of GAMs: still possible to plot \( f_i \) for each feature!
- **Result:** Nearly the accuracy of black-box DNNs, but each variable's role remains ‚Äúglass box‚Äù explainable.

## üõ†Ô∏è How Neural Additive Models Work

1. **Additive Decomposition:**  
   The model prediction is the sum of learnable functions, one for each input feature. This means each variable‚Äôs contribution is handled independently.

2. **Neural Parameterization:**  
   Instead of fitting splines or polynomials for each \( f_i \), NAMs use *small neural networks* for each. Each sub-network is free to learn any function suitable for the feature.

3. **Training:**  
   All sub-networks are trained together, using the same loss and optimizer as a regular DNN. The outputs of all feature sub-networks are summed to give the total prediction.

4. **Interpretability:**  
   Because each input‚Äôs effect is modeled alone, the shape \( f_i(x_i) \) for every feature can be visualized‚Äîjust like in old-school GAMs, but with more expressive, data-driven patterns.

5. **Use Cases:**  
   Whenever *interpretability + nonlinearity* are key: medicine, law, regulatory compliance, audit trails, business analytics.
